# Proxie Vision & Mission

## Mission Statement

Eliminate the digital tax on skilled work. Let anyone with a skill be discovered and hired through AI agents. No website, no social media, no algorithm games. Just their craft, fairly represented.

## Vision Statement

A world where consumer agents and provider agents negotiate and transact on behalf of humans — accessible only through AI interfaces. Humans describe needs. Humans do the work. Everything in between is agent-to-agent.

## Core Principles

### Agent-First
The primary interface is conversational, not a traditional UI. Both providers and consumers interact through agents.

### Interoperable
External agents (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, personal assistants) can query the platform. Proxie is infrastructure, not a walled garden.

### Provider-Owned Data
Providers control their information. They can export it, delete it, take it elsewhere.

### Trust as a Layer
Verification, reputation, and safety are built into the core, not bolted on.

### Simplicity
Launch small (one vertical, one city) and scale without rewriting everything.

## The World We Want to Create

**Skill matters more than marketing.** The best provider gets found because they are the best, not because they figured out hashtags.

**Individuals can thrive independently.** You do not need to join a gig platform that takes 30% and treats you as replaceable. You own your reputation, your data, your client relationships.

**Access to quality services is democratized.** Anyone can find a trustworthy, skilled person for what they need, not just people who know how to navigate Yelp or have friends to ask.

**Dignity is restored to service work.** The plumber, the nanny, the photographer: they are not gig workers grinding for ratings. They are skilled professionals, represented properly, valued for their craft.

## Our Role

Proxie is not a gig company. We do not employ anyone. We do not take a cut of labor. We are infrastructure. We are the layer that lets skilled individuals exist in the agentic economy without becoming tech-savvy marketers. We represent them, so they can focus on what they are good at.

## Elevator Pitch

> "Proxie connects skilled workers with people who need them through AI agents, not websites or ads. Describe your need, get matched instantly. Your craft is your only marketing."
